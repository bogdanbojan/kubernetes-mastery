ConfigMaps can be exposed as plain files in the filesystem of a container:

- This is achieved by decalring a volume and mounting it in the container
- This is particularly effective for ConfigMaps containing whole files

ConfigMaps can be exposed as environment variables in the container:

- This is achieved with the DownwardAPI
- This is particularly effective for ConfigMaps containing individual parameters

Passing a configuration file with a ConfigMap

We can try this ourselves, for instance:

- We can start a load balancer powered by HAProxy, using the official `haproxy`
image
- It will expect to find the configuration in `/usr/local/haproxy/haproxy.cfg`
- It will listen on port 80 and load balance connections between IBM and 
Google

---

Use `kubectl create configmap haproxy --from-file=haproxy.cfg` and check how 
that looks by doing `kubectl get configmap haproxy -o yaml`.

---

We need to configure the pod definition in order to use the ConfigMap:

```
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: haproxy
spec:
  volumes:
  - name: config
    configMap:
      name: haproxy
  containers:
  - name: haproxy
    image: haproxy
    volumeMounts:
    - name: config
      mountPath: /usr/local/etc/haproxy/
```

You can see the IP address of the haproxy pod by using: 
`kubectl get pod haproxy -o wide`. 

Also, another useful thing we can do is store it into a variable with: 
`IP=$(kubectl get pod haproxy -o json | jq -r .status.podIP)`

Exposing ConfigMaps with the DownwardAPI

We can test things out and run a Docker registry on a custom port. By default,
this registry listens on port 5000. This can be changed by setting the environment
variable `REGISTRY_HTTP_ADDR`. We are going to store the port number in a 
ConfigMap and then assign it to the pod.

Creating a ConfigMap with a single key:
`kubectl create configmap registry --from-literal=http.addr=0.0.0.0:80`

Checking the ConfigMap: 
`kubectl get configmap registry -o yaml`

Using the ConfigMap for the pod definition:
```
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: registry
spec:
  containers:
  - name: registry
    image: registry
    env:
    - name: REGISTRY_HTTP_ADDR
      valueFrom:
        configMapKeyRef:
          name: registry
          key: http.addr
```

The procedure for this is the same as the one exemplified above.

Passwords, tokens, sensitive information

These are mainly used for things which are *actually* secrets like:
- API keys
- Credentials
- etc.

Secrets are base64-encoded when shown with `kubectl get secretes -o yaml`.

\* This is just *encoding*, not *encryption*. 

With RBAC, we can authorize a user to access ConfigMaps, but not Secrets (since
they are two different kinds of resources).
