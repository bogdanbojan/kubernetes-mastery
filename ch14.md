Daemon sets

If we would want to scale things in a different way - for example, having one instance of `rng` per node. We *do not want* two instances of `rng` on the same node.

We can do that with a *daemon set*. It is not a deployment, it does not use replica sets.

---

We can't do `kubectl scale deployment rng --replicas=..` because:
- That does not guarantee that the `rng` containers will be distributed evenly
- If we add nodes later, they will not automatically run a copy of `rng`
- If we remove (or reboot) a node, one `rng` container will restart elsewhere

---

Daemon sets are great for cluster-wide, per-node processes:
- `kube-proxy`
- CNI network plugins
- Monitoring agents
- Hardware management tools (e.g. SCSI/FC HBA agents)
- etc.

They can also be restricted to run *only on some nodes*.

---

Daemon sets cannot be created from the CLI but we can easily use a `yaml` file to create the resource.

---

Save a deployment to a yaml 

`kubectl get deploy/rng -o yaml > rng.yml`

CLI does validation of the spec before sending it to the server. Therefore, if you would change the type in the manifest to `DaemonSet` it would output various errors when you would have tried to apply that `.yml`.

You can bypass that with `-f` and `--validate=false`.

---

We can have different resource types with the same name (i.e. a *deployment* and a *daemon set* both named `rng`)

---

Labels and selectors

The `rng` *service* is load balancing requests to a set of pods. The set of pods is defined by the *selector* of the `rng` service.

You can check this by running `kubectl describe service rng`

The selector is `app=rng`. Which means: "all the pods having the label `app=rng`".

\* They can have additional labels as well.

We can use selectors to get resources:

```
kubectl get pods -l app=rng
kubectl get pods --selector app=rng
```

---

When we create a deployment with `kubectl create deployment rng`, the deployment gets the label `app=rng`.

- The replica set created by the deployment will get that label
- The pods created by the replica set will get that label

Therefore:
- The pods created by the daemon will get that label

---

For the run command (i.e. `kubectl run stuff`), the label is `run=stuff` instead.
