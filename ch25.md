Look at kubernetes/ingress-nginx project

The two main sections in the YAML are:

NGINX Deployment (or DaemonSet) and all its required resources:
- Namespace
- ConfigMaps (storing NGINX configs)
- ServiceAccount (authenticate to Kubernetes API)
- Role/ClusterRole/RoleBindings (authorization to API parts)
- LimitRange (limit cpu/memory of NGINX)

Service to expose NGINX on 80/443

\* Different for each Kubernetes distribution.

Running NGINX on our cluster

For minikube:
`kubectl apply -f https://k8smastery.com/ic-nginx-hn.yaml`

See what's happening:
`kubectl describe -n ingress-nginx deploy/ingress-nginx-controller`

Example of an ingress resource:

```
apiVersion: networking.k8s.io/v1
kind: Ingress
metadata:
  name: cheddar
spec:
  rules:
  - host: cheddar.A.B.C.D.nip.io
    http:
      paths:
      - path: /
        pathType: Prefix
        backend:
          service:
            name: cheddar
            port:
              number: 80
```
