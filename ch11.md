It's important to keep in mind that when talking about services finding out the address of each other:
- We do not hard-code IP addresses in the code
- We do not hard-code FQDNs in the code, either
- We just connect to a service name, and container-magic does the rest (the crafty, dynamic, embedded DNS server, that is)

There is no registry in Kubernetes by default.

For development using Docker, it has *build, ship* and *run* features. On a cluster, things are different. Kubernetes doesn't have a *build* feature built-in.

Therefore, the way to ship (pull) images to Kubernetes is to use a *registry*.

Docker registries

For example, when we execute `docker run alpine`:
- If the Engine needs to pull the `alpine` image, it expands it into `library/alpine`
- Then, `library/alpine` is expanded into `index.docker.io/library/alpine`
- The Engine communicates with `index.docker.io` to retrieve `library/alpine:latest`
- If we want to use something else than `index.docker.io`, we specify it in the image name (e.g. `docker build -t registry.mycompany.io:5000/myimage:awesome .`)

When it comes to building and shipping images, we can do it:
- Manually 
    - Build locally (with `docker build` or otherwise)
    - Push to the registry
- Automatically
    - Build and test locally
    - When ready, commit and push a code repository
    - The code repository notifies an automated build system
    - That system gets the code, builds it, pushes the image to the registry
