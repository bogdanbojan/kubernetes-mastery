## Kubernetes architecture

### The Nodes
 
 The nodes executing the container have:
 - a container Engine
 - kubelet (the "node agent")
 - kube-proxy (necessary but not sufficient network component)

---

### The Control Plane

The Kubernetes logic is a collection of services:
- the API server (entrypoint to everything)
- core services like the scheduler and controller manager
- `etcd` (key-value store; the "database" of Kubernetes)

Together, this is the *control plane* of our cluster (sometimes called "master").

It is common to have a dedicated node for the control plane. Except when using single-node development clusters like minikube.

This node would be called a "master".

You can also replicate it on multiple nodes ("multi-master" setup).

### Pods

- the smallest deployable unit; Kubernetes can't manage containers directly.
- IP adresses are associated with *pods*, not with individual containers.
- containers in a pod share `localhost`, and can share volumes.
