Create a pod with a default alpine image that is going to overrite the default cmd which will ping a common DNS service from Cloudflare: `kubectl run pingpong --image alpine ping 1.1.1.1` since `1.18` use: `kubectl create deployment pingpong --image=alpine -- ping 1.1.1.1 `

The abstractizations:
-  Deployment (resource) -> ReplicaSet (resource) -> Pod (resource) -> Container

A *deployment* is a high-level construct:
- allows scaling, rolling updates, rollbacks
- multiple deplyments can be used together to implement a *canary deployment*
- delegates pods management to *replica sets*

A *replica-set* is a low-level construct:
- makes sure that a given number of identical pods are running
- allows scaling
- rarely used directly

---

`kubectl logs` needs a *pod name* or a *type/name*. 

! Unless specified otherwise, it will show the logs of the first container in the pod. You can see this here as well: ` kubectl logs deployment.apps/pingpong --tail 1 --follow` outputs: `Found 3 pods, using pod/pingpong-5fb79f4bc8-ndcq6`

---

`kubectl scale deployment <name> --replicas <nr>` / `kubectl scale deployment.apps/<name> --replicas <nr>` /

It doesn't have to know what you have/ how many you have. It essentially just tells kubernetes to scale this to this particular number.

---

`kubectl delete pod` terminates the pod gracefully (sends the TERM signal and waits for it to shutdown).

As soon as the pod is in "Terminating" state, the Replica Set replaces it. 30 sec later, the grace perios expires and the pod is then killed and `kubectl logs` exits.
