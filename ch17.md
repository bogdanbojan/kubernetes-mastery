Server-side dry run

Server-side dry run will do all the work, but *not* persist to etcd.
For instance: `kubectl apply -f web.yaml --server-dry-run --validate=false -o yaml`

The resulting YAML doesn't have the `replicas` field anymore.

`kubectl diff` does a server-side dry run, *and* shows differences.

```
curl -O https://k8smastery.com/just-a-pod.yaml
kubectl apply -f just-a-pod.yaml
// Then change something in just-a-pod.yaml
kubectl diff -f just-a-pod.yaml
```
