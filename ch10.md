Our cluster (nodes and pods) is one big flat IP network.
 
---

Pods have level 3 (IP) connectivity, but services are level 4 (TCP or UDP). Services actually map to a single UDP or TCP port; no port ranges or arbitrary IP packets.

`kube-proxy` is on the data path when connecting to a pod or container, and it's not particularly fast (relies on userland proxying or iptables).

There are alternatives to `kube-proxy` like `kube-router` but you don't really need it. Unless you:
- Routinely saturate 10G network interfaces
- Count packet rates in millions per second
- Run high-traffic VOIP or gaming platforms
- Do weird things that involve millions of simultaneous connections (in which case you're already familiar with kernel tuning)

Most Kubernetes clusters use CNI (The Container Networking Interface) "plugins" to implement neworking.

When a pod is created, Kubernetes delegates the network setup to these plugins.

Typically, CNI plugins will:
- Allocate and IP address (by calling an IPAM plugin)
- Add a network interface into the pod's network namespace
- Configure the interface as well as required routes, etc.

The "pod-to-pod network" / "pod network":
- Provides communication between pods and nodes
- Is generally implemented with CNI plugins

The "pod-to-service network":
- Provides internal communication and load balancing
- Is generally implemented with kube-proxy

Network policies:
- Provide firewalling and isolation
- Can be bundled with the "pod network" or provided by another component
