Attaching to a process that is already running inside an existing container: `kubectl attach --namespace=shpod -ti shpod`, for example.

Obtain the IP address of a service, programatically: `IP=$(kubectl get svc httpenv -o go-template --template '{{ .spec.clusterIP}})'`

---

You can also use headless services. A headless service is obtained by setting the `clusterIP` field to `None` (either with `--cluster-ip=None`, or by providing a custom YAML).

- As a result, the service doesn't have a virtual IP address
- Therefore, it will not have a load balancer either
- CoreDNS will return the pods' IP addresses as multiple `A` records
- Easy way to discover all the replicas for a deployment

---

A service has a number of "endpoints". Each endpoint is a host + port where the service is available. The endpoints are maintained and updated automatically by Kubernetes.

You can check these endpoints for the `httpenv` service and see them for yourself: `kubectl describe service httpenv`. In the line `Endpoints:` there are a bunch of addresses in `host:port` format.

You can see the full list of endpoints (if you have lots of them they will be trimmed): `kubectl get endpoints httpenv -o yaml`.

You can compare those addresses with the corresponding pods: `kubectl get pods -l app=httpenv -o wide`.

The default type (ClusterIP) only works for internal traffic.

For accepting external traffic, we can use:
- NodePort (expose a service on a TCP port between 30000-32768)
- LoadBalancer (provision a cloud load balancer for our service)
- ExternalIP (use one node's external IP address)
- Ingress (a special mechanism for HTTP services)
