If we would like to remove a pod from the load balancer, the `kubectl delete pod` would re-create it immediately (by the replica set or the daemon set). The same thing would happen if we use the `app=rng` label.

---

The "mission" of a replica set is:
- "Make sure that there is the right number of pods matching this spec!"

The "mission" of a daemon set is:
- "Make sure that there is a pod matching this spec on each node!"

---

Since both the `rng` daemon set and the `rng` replica set use `app=rng`, the reason that they don't "find" each other's pods is:

- *Replica sets* have a more specific selector, visible with `kubectl describe` (it looks like `app=rng, pod-template-hash=abcd123`)
- *Daemon sets* also have a more specific selector, but it's invisible (it looks like `app=rng, controller-revision-hash=abcd123`)

As a result, each controller only "sees" the pods it manages.

---

If we want to remove a pod from the load balancer, we need to change the selector of the `rng` service.

If a selector specifies multiple labels, they are understood as a logical *AND*.

Therefore, what we could do is:

- Add the label `active=yes` to all our rng pods
- Update the selector for the rng service to also include `active=yes`
- Toggle traffic to a pod by manually adding/removing the `active` label

---

First, in order to add the label `app=rng` to all the pods: `kubectl label pods -l app=rng enabled=yes`

Then, we need to edit the service specification with `kubectl edit service rng`

We will see `app: rng` in two places:
- the label of the service itself
- the selector of the service

\* Pay attention when editing the YAML because the parser takes `yes` as the boolean value `true`. 
Or `42` as the integer `42`. Therefore, you need to `""` surround them in quotes.

---

We can check the logs of that pod:

```
POD=$(kubectl get pod -l app=rng,pod-template-hash -o name)
kubectl logs --tail 1 --follow $POD
```

This will show us a steady stream of HTTP logs.

And then, in another window we can remove the label from the pod:

`kubectl label pod -l app=rng,pod-template-hash enabled-`

And then, the stream of HTTP logs should stop immediately.

\* Make sure that `app=rng,pod-template-hash` there is no " " space after the 
`,` since that will make the command error out with `error: name cannot be 
provided when a selector is specified`.

---

If we scale up our cluster by adding new nodes, the daemon set will create more 
pods. These pods won't have the `enabled=yes` label.

We can edit the daemon set spec with: `kubectl edit daemonset rng`.

---

Reminder: a daemon set is a resource that creates more resources.

There is a difference between:
- the label(s) of a resource (in the `metadata` block in the beginning.
- the selector of a resource (in the `spec` block)
- the label(s) of the resource(s) created by the first resource (in the `template`
block)

We would need to update the selector and the template. Also, the template must 
match the selector.
