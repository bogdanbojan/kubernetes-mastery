Our version number can be anything from git hashes, dates, CI number generation
, etc. We can list successive versions of a Deployment with: `kubectl rollout
history deployment <NAME>`.

---

You can also check the annotations for your replica set: `kubectl describe 
replicasets -l app=worker | grep -A3 Annotations`.

The missing revisions are stored in another annotation:
`deployment.kubernetes.io\revision-history`.

---

You can use YAML to do everything at once:
- Change image to v0.1.
- Be conservative on availability (always have desired number of available 
workers)
- Go slow on rollout speed (update only one pod at a time)
- Give some time to our workers to "warm up" before starting more.

```
spec:
  template:
    spec:
    - name: worker
      image: dockercoins/worker:v0.1
  strategy:
    rollingUpdate:
      maxUnavailable: 0 
      maxSurge: 1
  minReadySeconds: 10
```

---

Applying the changes can be done with `kubectl edit deployment worker` or just 
by using `kubectl patch`.

Check what you've done by doing:
`kubectl get deploy -o json worker | jq "{name:.metada.name} + 
.spec.strategy.rollingUpdate"`
