Exposing HTTP services with Ingress resources

*Services* give us a way to access a pod or a set of pods. 

They can be exposed to the outside world:
- With type `NodePort` (on a port > 30000)
- With type `LoadBalancer` (allocating an external load balancer)

When talking about HTTP services, they can receive connections through a proxy
(reverse proxy in this case). Say you need multiple services on port 80 when 
they are running on the same cluster (consequently, within the same IP address).

---

If we use `NodePort` services, clients have to specify port numbers:
(i.e. http://xxxxx:31234 instead of just http://xxxxx)

If we use `LoadBalancer`:
- They are not available in all environments
- They often carry an additional cost (e.g. they provision an ELB)
- They often work at OSI Layer 4 (IP+Port) and not Layer 7 (HTTP/S)
- They require one extra step for DNS integration
(waiting for the LoadBalancer to be provisioned; then adding it to DNS)

We could build our own reverse proxy. 

Or of course use an already existing one like Apache, HAProxy, Envoy Proxy, 
Gloo, NGINX, Traefik, etc. But here, most of these require us to update/ edit
configuration files after each change.

Ingress resources

ingress = entering
egress = leaving

Ingress, in networking, refers to handling incoming connections (firewall, 
network, or in this case, a server cluster).

Ingress is specific to HTTP/S.

`kubectl get ingress`/`ingresses`/`ing`

Basic features:
- Load balancing
- SSL termination
- Name-based virtual hosting

It can also route to different services depending on:
- URL path
- Client headers, including cookies (for A/B testing, canary deployment, etc.)

Principles of operation



Step 1: deploy an Ingress controller
- Ingress controller = load balancing proxy + control loop
- the control loop watches over Ingress resources, and configures the LB accordingly
- these might be two separate processes (NGINX sever + NGINX Ingress controller)
- or a single app that knows how to speak to Kubernetes API (Traefik)

Step 2: set up DNS (usually)
- associate external DNS entries with the load balancer or host address

 Step 3: create Ingress resources for our Service resources
- these resources contain rules for handling HTTP/S connections
- the Ingress controller picks up these resources and configures the LB
- connections to the Ingress LB will be processed by the rules

Normally, each pod gets its own *network namespace* (sometimes called sandbox 
or network sandbox).

Then, an IP address (IP subnet) is assigned to the pod.

This IP address is routed/connected to the cluster network.

All containers of that pod are sharing that network namespace (and therefore, 
using the same IP address).

---

with `hostNetwork: true`:


- No network namespace gets created
- The pod is using the network namespace of the host
- It "sees" (and can use) the interfaces (and IP addresses) of the host (VM on macOS/Win)
- The pod can receive outside traffic directly, on any port
- Downside: with most network plugins, network policies won't work for that pod
---
- Most network policies work at the IP address level
- Filtering that pod = filtering traffic from the node
