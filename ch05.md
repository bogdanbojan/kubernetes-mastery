`kubectl` is a CLI tool around the Kubernetes API. Everything you can do with `kubectl`, you can do directly with the API.

`~/.kube/config` holds:
- the Kubernetes API address
- path to our TLS certificates
- user

Get the resource types:

`kubectl get nodes` / `kubectl get node` / `kubectl get no`

You can outuput JSON/ YAML or directly formatted:

`kubectl get nodes -o wide`
`kubectl get no -o yaml`

You can also build custom reports on a JSON stream:

`kubectl get no -o json | jq ".items[] | {name:.metadata.name} + .status.capacity"`

Describe needs a resource type and (optionally) a resource name. It gets us quite a hefty sum of details in human-friendly format.

`kubectl describe node <node>` / `kubectl describe node/<node>`

---

See all the api resources that kubernetes has:

`kubectl api-resources`

In order to view the definition for a resource type (introspection):

`kubectl explain <type>`

You can also view the definition of a field in a resource, for instance:

`kubectl explain node.spec`

Or get all the fields and sub-fields:

`kubectl explain node --recursive`

---

A service is a stable enpoint to connect to "something".

`kubectl get services` / `kubectl get svc`
