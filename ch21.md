This is smart: making another endpoint that takes care of the healthchecks 
so that the healthchecks don't mix up with our client connections.

You can use `kubectl apply -f .` to tell Kubernetes to use all the files from
the current dir.

`kubectl get events -w` to monitor cluster events.

---

You can use Apache Bench to send concurrent requests to `rng`.

`kubectl attach --namespace=shpod -ti shpod ab -c 10 -n 1000 https://<ClusterIP>/1`

\* The final `/1` is important to generate actual traffic (otherwise we would 
use the ping endpoint, which doesn't sleep 0.1s per request).

Liveness checks during periods of excess load

For example, in an imaginary scenario, if a liveness probe fails 3 times in a 
row, the container is restarted. During the restart, there is *less* capacity 
available:
- Meaning that the other backends are likely to timeout as well
- Eventually causing all backedns to be restarted 
- And each fresh backend gets restarted, too

This will go on until the load goes down, or we add capacity.

We need to make sure that the healthcheck doesn't trip when performance degrades
due to external pressure. Therefore, using a readiness check would have fewer 
effects (but it would still be an imperfect solution).

A possible combination:
- Readiness check with a short timeout / low failure threshold
- Liveness check with a longer timeout / higher failure threshold

When using exec probes, we should make sure that we have a *zombie reaper*.

I.e. when a process terminates, its parent must call `wait()`/ `waitpid()` (this 
is how the parent process retrieves the child's exit status). In the meantime, 
the process is in a *zombie* state (the process state will show as `Z` in `ps`, 
`top`..).

When a process is killed, its children are *orphaned* and attached to PID 1. 
PID 1 has the responsibility of *reaping* these processes when they terminate.

On ordinary systems, PID 1 (`/sbin/init`) has logic to reap processes. In 
containers, PID 1 is typically our application process (e.g. Apache, the JVM,
NGINX, Redis ...). These *do not* take care of reaping orphans.

If we use exec probes, we need to add a process reaper. We can add **tini** to
our images or **share the PID namespace between containers of a pod**.
