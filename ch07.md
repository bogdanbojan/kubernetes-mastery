`kubectl run` creates a pod. 

This is useful especially when we want to start a "one-shot" container that doesn't get restarted.

You can write these resource descriptions ourselves (typically in YAML) and create them on the cluster with `kubectl apply -f`.

If we don't want the container to get restarted we can use `kubectl run --restart=Never` or `kubectl run --restart=OnFailure`.

---

With `kubectl run --schedule=..` we can create *cron-jobs* as well. For example: `kubectl run --schedule="*/3 * * * *" --restart=OnFailure --image=alpine sleep 10`

At the specified schedule, the Cron Job will create a Job -> The Job will create a Pod -> The Job will make sure that the Pod completes. You can check this by running `kubectl get jobs`.

---

When creating resources with `kubectl create -f foo.yaml` / `kubectl apply -f foo.yaml` all the features are available, whereas when we use `kubectl run` or `kubectl create <resource>` we are *a bit* limited.

---

You can use labels to stream the logs of multiple containers (<= 5 containers but can be changed by using `--max-log-request` flag):
- `kubectl logs -l run=pingpong --tail 1 -f` 

\* This can easily overwhelm control plane's API.

---

The downsides of the `kubectl logs` can be addressed with third-party tools like Stern.

The downsides being:
- We don't see which pod sent which log line
- If pods are restarted/ replaced, the log stream stops
- If new pods are added, we don't see their logs
- To stream the logs of multiple pods, we need to write a selector
