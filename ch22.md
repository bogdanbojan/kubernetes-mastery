Managing configuration

There are many ways for our code to pick up configuration:
- Command-line arguments
- Environment variables
- Configuration files
- Configuration servers (getting configuration from a database, an API, etc.)

There are many ways to pass configuration to code running in a container:
- Baking it into a custom image
- Command-line arguments
- Environment variables
- Injecting configuration files
- Exposing it over the Kubernetes API
- Configuration servers

---

Baking custom images

We can put the configuration in the image (it can be in a configuration file,
but also `ENV` or `CMD` actions).

It has some downsides:
- Multiplication of images
- Different images for dev, staging, prod, etc.
- Minor reconfigurations require a whole build/push/pull cycle

Avoid doing it..

---

Command-line arguments

Pass options to `args` array in the container specification.

For instance:

```
  args: 
    - "--data-dir=/var/lib/etcd"
    - "--advertise-client-urls=http://127.0.0.1:2379"
    - "--listen-client-urls=http://127.0.0.1:2379"
    - "--listen-peer-urls=http://127.0.0.1:2380"
    - "--name=etcd"
```

The options can also be passed directly to the program that we run or to a 
wrapper script that will use them to generate a config file, for example.

\+
- Works great when options are passed directly to the running program
- Works great when there aren't too many parameters
- Well suited for mandatory parameters (without default values)


\-

- Requires documentantion and/or understanding of the underlying program 
(to know which parameters/flags to pass)
- Not ideal when we need ot pass a real configuration file anyway

---

Environment variables

Pass options through the `env` map in the container specification.

For example:

```
  env:
  - name: ADMIN_PORT
    value: "8080"
  - name: ADMIN_AUTH
    value: Basic
  - name: ADMIN_CRED
    value: "admin:0pensesame!"
```

\* Value must be a string. Make sure that numbers and fancy strings are quotable.

The Downward API

In the previous examples, environment variables have fixed values.

The Downward API allows exposing pod or container information:
- Through special files
- Through environment variables

The value of these environment variables is computed when the container is 
started. It is important to mention that these environment variables won't 
(can't) change after container start.


```
- name: MY_POD_NAMESPACE
  valueFrom:
    fieldRef:
      fieldPath: metadata.namespace
```

Other namespaces can be reached by using the fully qualified domain name (FQDN):

```
curl api-backend
curl api-backend.$MY_POD_NAMESPACE.svc.cluster.local
```

---

Exposing the pod's IP address:

```
- name: MY_POD_IP
  valueFrom:
    fieldRef:
      fieldPath: status.podIP
```

We can find out our IP address by reading it from the `eth0`, but this is more 
convinient.

---

Exposing the container's resource limits

```
    - name: MY_MEM_LIMIT
      valueFrom:
        resourceFieldRef:
          containerName: test-container
          resource: limits.memory
```

This is useful for runtimes where memory is garbage collected.

For example, the JVM - the memory available to the JVM should be set with the 
`-Xmx` flag. And so, the best practice is to set a memory limit, and pass it to 
the runtime.

\* Recent versions of JVM can do this automatically. Therefore, now you can 
see the limits of `cgroups`.

---

Environment variables 

\+

- Works great when the running program expects these variables
- Works great for optional parameters with reasonable defaults (since the 
container image can provide these defaults)
- Sort of auto-documented (we can see which environment variables are defined
in the image, and their values)

\-

- Can be abused with longer values..
- You can, in theory, an entire Tomcat configuration file in an environment..
but should you?

Injecting configuration files with ConfigMaps

A ConfigMap is a Kubernetes resource that exists in a namespace. Conceptually,
it is a key-value map. It enables us to inject a full config file.

We can think about them in two different ways:

- As holding entire configuration file(s)
- As holding individual configuration parameters

---

You can store entire files with ConfigMaps. Each key-value pair corresponds to 
a configuration file. Key = name of the file *and* Value = content of the file.

For example:

```
# Create a ConfigMap with a single key, "app.conf"
kubectl create configmap my-app-config --from-file=app.conf
# Create a ConfigMap with a single key, "app.conf" but another file
kubectl create configmap my-app-config --from-file=app.conf=app-prod.conf
# Create a ConfigMap with multiple keys (one per file in the config.d directory)
kubectl create configmap my-app-config --from-file=config.d/
```

---

You can also store individual parameters with ConfigMaps. In this case, each 
key-value pair corresponds to a parameter. Key = name of the parameter *and*
Value = value of the parameter.

```
# Create a ConfigMap with two keys
kubectl create cm my-app-config \
  --from-literal=foreground=red \
  --from-literal=background=blue
# Create a ConfigMap from a file containing key=val pairs
kubectl create cm my-app-config \
  --from-env-file=app.conf
```
