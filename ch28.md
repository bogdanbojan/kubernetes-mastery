Ingress resources

\+

The traffic flows directly from the ingress load balancer to the backends:
- It doesn't need to go through the ClusterIP
- In fact, we don't even need a ClusterIP (we can use a headless service)

The load balancer can be outside of Kubernetes (as long as it has access to 
the cluster subnet)

- This allows the use of external (hardware, physical machines...) load balancers
- Annotations can encode special features (rate-limiting, A/B testing, 
session stickiness, etc.)

\-


- Aforementioned "special features" are not standardized yet
- Some controllers will support them; some won't
- Even relatively common features (stripping a path prefix) can differ:
    - Traefik.ingress.kubernetes.io/rule-type: PathPrefixStrip
    - Ingress.kubernetes.io/rewrite-target: /
- Annotations are not validated in CLI
- Some proxies provide a CRD (Custom Resource Definition) option

When not to use built-in Ingress resources:



- You need features beyond Ingress including:
    - TCP support, traffic splitting, mTLS, egress, service mesh
    - Response transformation, routing to 2+ services
- You have external load balancers (like AWS ELBs) which route to NodePorts
- You don't need externally available HTTP services on the default ports
- Your proxy of choice uses a CRD rather then a Ingress Resource
