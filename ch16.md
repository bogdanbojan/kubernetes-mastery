YAML refresher
- Technically a superset of JSON
- Spaces set the structure
- No tabs
- Two spaces standard, four work too
- Supports key/value pairs, arays, maps, etc.

---

Manifests

- Can be written in JSON as well
- Each file contains one or more manifests
- Each manifest describes an API object (deployment, service, etc.)
- Each manifest needs four parts (root key:values in the file)
```
apiVersion:
kind:
metadata:
spec:
```

It's useful to use an existing resource in order to create a YAML:
- Create a resource
- Dump its YAML with `kubectl get -o yaml .. `
- Edit the YAML
- Use `kubectl apply -f ..` to update the resource/ create new one

---

Generating YAML without creating resources

We can use `-o yaml --dry-run` option with `run` and `create`.

For instance: `kubectl create deployment web --image nginx -o yaml --dry-run=client`

---

Creating YAML from scratch

- Find the resource `kind` you want to create - using `kubectl api-resources`
- Find the latest `apiVersion` your cluster supports for your kind - using 
`kubectl api-versions` (this appears in the `API_VERSION` column of `kubectl
api-resources`)
- Give it a `name` in metadata
- Most of the info is found in the `spec` of the `kind`
    - `kubectl explain <kind>.spec`
    - `kubectl explain <kind> --recursive`
