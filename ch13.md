`kubectl create deployment` and similar commands are generator commands - they generate the YAML for us and then turn it into JSON technically and send it to the server.

`kubectl create -f foo.yaml` vs `kubectl apply -f foo.yaml`

- `create` only creates the resources if they don't exist. If resources already exist, it doesn't alter them.

- `apply` creates the resources if they don't exist. If resources already exist, it updates them. It also stores the manifest as an annotation in the resource.

The manifest can contain multiple resources separated by `---`:

```
 kind: ...
 apiVersion: ...
 metadata:
   name: ...
   ...
 spec:
   ...
 ---
 kind: ...
 apiVersion: ...
 metadata:
   name: ...
   ...
 spec: 
   ...
```

Kuberenetes resources can also be viewed with an official web UI. Dashboard users need to authentificate and obtain a proper TLS certificate (since it's exposed over HTTPS).

You need to follow the official Kubernetes guide in order to install and use it properly.

You can also do `minikube dashboard` to enable its dashboard locally.

Erm, keep in mind that `kubectl apply` is the new `curl | sh`.
